LLMBot is a message queue based IM Bot developed around the concept of an intelligent robot assistant that can be loaded
with plugins to perform many functions. Implemented with Openai's new Feature `gpt-function-call`
support.

| Demo                              | 
|-----------------------------------|
| ![sticker](./docs/chain_chat.gif) |

Unlike previous projects, this project tries to replicate ChatGpt's plugin system based on the messaging platform,
implementing some or more features.

> Because func call is a feature, it only supports Openai type api, and does not intend to support LLM without func
> call.

## 📦 Feature

- 🍪 Call a number of pre-defined functions in natural language, use `pip` install every plugin you need.
- 📝 Messaging system, define send receivers and data can be delivered to the llm chain.
- 📎 Subscription system, which can subscribe to multiple senders in addition to paired senders, with push functionality.
- 📦 Non-question-and-answer binding, unlimited time and unlimited sender triggered response.
- 📬 Customizable ApiKey and Endpoint, traceability of sender authentication info.
- 🍾 Easy Interactive Experience.
- 🎵 Fine-grained consumption data storage, statistics on plugin credit consumption.
- 🍖 Continuous session design for function plugins
