<h2 align="center">OpenaiBot</h2>

[中文说明](https://github.com/LlmKira/Openaibot/blob/main/README_ZH.md)

直觉性设计的全平台Bot，多轮会话管理，多模态(语音/图片)理解，自维护套件，交叉追溯回复。

If you don't have the instant messaging platform you need or you want to develop a new application, you are welcome to
contribute to this repository.

You can develop a new Controller by using `Event.py`.

Compatibility with multiple LLMs and integration with GPT and third-party systems is handled by
our [llm-kira](https://github.com/LLMKira/llm-kira) project on
GitHub.

**Please submit an issue/discussion if you have a deployment issue rather than emailing me**

## 🥽 Feature

## 🪜 Deploy It

### 🔨 Check

Make sure your server has 1GB of RAM and 10GB of free storage.

For Arm architecture servers: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` (The setup.sh can now
automatically install rust.)

### 📦 Deploy/Renew

```shell

Or [Docker Deploy](https://llmkira.github.io/Docs/guide/getting-started#docker)

### 🍽 Configure

- set Redis

```shell
apt-get install redis
systemctl enable redis.service --now
```

- edit bot config

```shell
cp Config/app_exp.toml Config/app.toml

nano Config/app.toml
```

```toml
# Comment out which part you don't want to start
# 注释你不需要的部分

# QQ Bot
[Controller.QQ]
master = [114, 514] # QQ number
account = 0  # Bot s QQ number
http_host = 'http://localhost:8080'   # Mirai http Server
ws_host = 'http://localhost:8080'   # Mirai Websocket Server
verify_key = ""
trigger = false # Proactive response when appropriate
INTRO = "POWER BY OPENAI"  # Suffixes for replies
ABOUT = "Created by github.com/LLMKira/Openaibot" # /about
WHITE = "Group NOT in WHITE list" # Whitelist/Blacklist tips

[Controller.BaseServer]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 9559
```

If you want configure the backend or openai proxy. Please
Check [Deploy Docs](https://llmkira.github.io/Docs/guide/service)

### 🪶 App Token

- Telegram

[Telegram BotToken Request](https://t.me/BotFather)

Make sure *the bot is a group admin* or *privacy mode is turned off*.

- QQ

[Configuring the QQ bot](https://graiax.cn/before/install_mirai.html)

### 🌻 Run Bot

Our robots can be started in multiple processes.

```shell
apt install npm
npm install pm2@latest -g
# or
yarn global add pm2

# test_feature bot
python3 main.py

# run bot
pm2 start pm2.json


pm2 status

# stop bot
pm2 stop pm2.json
pm2 stop xx(id)
pm2 restart x(id)
```

Once configured, send a message and use the `/add_white_user` command to add your platform ID returned by the bot to the
whitelist and you will be able to talk.
Or use `/close_group_white_mode` to turn off the bot's *group whitelist* mode.

### 🎤 Or Run Voice Assistant

In addition to the robot, we also have a voice assistant.

Voice Assistant is a web-dependent voice assistant that you can easily run on small devices through Azure or Openai's
recognition services.

- Run BaseEvent Server

```toml
# 基础对话事件服务器，Web支持或者音箱用
[Controller.BaseServer]
port = 9559
```

- Run Vits Server

https://github.com/LlmKira/MoeGoe

- Run Assistant

```shell
cd Assistant
cat install.md
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 clinet.py
```

### 🥕 Add Api Key

Use `/add_api_key` Command add [OpenaiKey](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to `Config/api_keys.json`.

### 🫧 About ID

You'll be wondering about our multi-platform ID system. This is how we store your ID in our
json/database: `real_id` + `suffix`.

- toml

Use your real ID in `app.toml`, which is the whitelist prompt without the suffix.

- json/command

When using the user/group authorization command, you need to follow the real ID with the corresponding suffix ID.

| Controller | suffix_id | desc |
|------------|-----------|------|
| QQ         | 101       |      |
| Telegram   | 100       |      |
| Api        | 103       |      |

### 🥪 About Models

#### ChatGpt

| models             | token limit | cost                                                       |

#### GPT3

| models           | token limit | cost                                                          |

### Keyword filtering configuration

To prevent malicious inducement and attacks, we have two measures: OpenAI TosApi filtering and simplified/traditional
Chinese
keyword filtering.

*Simplified/traditional Chinese keyword filtering(Only For Chinese)*

If not exist, the sensitive word file will be automatically initialized into `Data/Danger.form`, and it can be disabled
by clearing it to one line.

*OpenAI TosApi filtering*

Leave the inspection type array empty to disable the filter.

Please see [Service Configuration Guide](https://llmkira.github.io/Docs/guide/service).

### 🌽 `/Config` File

Our `llm-kira` dependency library is stored in the current package directory when there is no Redis support.

The application itself is stored in Redis for robustness, except for `api_keys.json`, `service.json`
and `assistants.json`.

If you have `config.json`, the application will automatically initialise this file. And you can update the configuration
to this file using the `/config` command.
